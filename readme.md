This repository contains the code of the 

<h3>"Stabilizing sequence learning in stochastic spiking networks with GABA-Modulated STDP"</h3>

paper by Marius Vieth and Jochen Triesch (2024).

To execute the three experiments in the Paper you have to execute: 

- Experiments/Experiment_bar.py,
- Experiments/Experiment_char.py and
- Experiments/Experiment_token.py .

By default they show PymoNNto's interactive Graphical User Interface. 
If you just want to run the experiments without the GUI you have to set 

- "ui = True" 
- => 
- "ui = False"

at the beginning of each file.
